        <p>Wong supported himself as a photographer and as a dancer (appearing in rock videos with David Bowie,<br> Donna Summer,<br>
          and Janet Jackson,<br> among others) before scoring his first screen roles in 1985,<br>
          appearing in a Hong Kong musical called Ge wu sheng ping (aka Musical Dancer) and in a <br>
          screen adaptation of James Clavell's best-seller Tai-Pan (as Gordon Chen). A number of television and film roles followed,<br>
          including an appearance as Narong Bansari on an episode of the 80s crime show The Equalizer,<br>
          but Wong began breaking into better roles in 1989,<br>
          when he made a memorable guest appearance on the drama series 21 Jump Street <br>
          (as Locke in the episode "The Dragon and the Angel") and won a leading role in Wayne Wang's acclaimed independent <br>
          romantic comedy Eat a Bowl of Tea as Ben Loy. He also played a rising Chinese American gangster named <br>
          Yung Gan in Abel Ferrara's China Girl,<br> a Romeo and Juliet love story film about the conflicts between <br>
          Chinese gangsters and the Italian mob in New York</p>
